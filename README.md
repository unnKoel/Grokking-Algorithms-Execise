This project contains my answers, and proofs to the exercises from an algorithm-focused book called Grokking Algorithms. 

The proof part is very interesting which uses some math knowledge, as the rational explanation is a process of convincine oneself. That's best gain I got from this reading process.

The reason I shared it with the open-source community is that others reading this book can use my answers as a reference if they find them helpful.
Feel free to reach out to me for discussion whenever you have a problem.
