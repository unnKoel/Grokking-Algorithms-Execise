1. why does the quicksort complete in O(nlog n) time on average? 

   n / 2 this type of computation conducts serval times until its result equals to 1.
   
   its inverse operation of the multiplication is 1 * 2 * 2, how much of times you multiply determines the result n, that can be denoted as log n in math.

   Prove process:

   Each time, each sub group executeing the quicksort will determine the position of the pivot selected. so they should be removed from comparasion operation.

   n + (n - 2) + (n - 4) + (n - 8) + ... + (n - n), the count is log n.

   n + (n - 2) + (n - 4) + (n - 8) + ... + (n - n) = (n - 1/x * n) * log n, x > 1;

   (n - 1/x * n) * log n = (x-1)/x * nlog n;

   when n → ∞, x → ∞, then (x-1)/x → 1;

   so O(nlog n) is proved.
