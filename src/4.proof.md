1. why does the quicksort complete in O(nlog n) time on average? 

   n / 2 this type of computation conducts serval times until its result equals to 1.
   
   its inverse operation of the multiplication is 1 * 2 * 2, how much of times you multiply determines the result n, that can be denoted as log n in math.

   Prove process:

   Each time, each sub group executeing the quicksort will determine the position of the pivot selected. so they should be removed from comparasion operation.

   (n - 1) + (n - 3) + (n - 5) + (n - 9) + ... + 1, the count is log n.

   (n - 2^0) + (n - (2^1+1)) + (n - (2^2+1)) + ... + 1 
   
   = nlogn - logn - (2^1 + 2^2+...+2^logn)

   = nlogn - logn - 2(n-1) (According to https://chatgpt.com/share/67f60309-7dc4-800e-a5cd-66d36d7d5d48)
   
   = (n-1)logn - 2(n-1) = (n-1)(logn-2) = nlogn

   so O(nlog n) is proved.

2. why does the quicksort complete in O(nÂ²) time on worst?

   prove process:

   each time reduce one for the comparison operation. totally demand runing n time.

   (n-1) + (n-2) + (n-3) ...+ 2 + 1 = n/2

   (n/2) * n  = 1/2 * n^2

   so O(n^2) is proved.
